    <p>Senna is a champion who is viable in both ADC and Support. This guide will focus more on the ADC side.</p>
      <div class="centerdiv1"><h2 class="Gameplan">Gameplan</h2></div>
    <p>The goal as Senna ADC is to scale safely to become a late game monster.
      The key lies within her passive which spawns souls which Senna can then
      collect for a boost in her stats, including extra Attack Damage, Crit Chance,
      Range, and Lifesteal. All these stats contirubute significantly to Senna's
      overall strength.</p>
      <div class="centerdiv1"><h2 class="Items">Items</h2></div>
    <p>Senna typically rushes Statikk Shiv to fix the issue of low waveclear.
      Her Q is a costly spell, and should often be used against enemy champions
      rather than the enemy minion wave. After Statikk Shiv, go Swiftness Boots
      into Black Cleaver. Swiftness Boots give her the extra boost in mobility,
      helping kiting, and Black Cleaver provides incredible synergy for the team
      as Senna applies two stacks of it every auto attack. After the core build,
      you can opt between Infinity Edge (Recomended Crit Synergy), Rapidfire Cannon
      (Long Range auto attack), Bloodthirster (Lifesteal), Mortal Reminder
      (if need Anti-Heal and not using Black Cleaver), and Edge of Night
      (Spellshield).
