        "Looks my stupid jungler locked in an absolute braindead pick". I am not
        troll and will explain the pick to you. Keep in mind I am still new and
        learning jungle so do not blame the pick but blame me instead. Her clear
        speed is very good for an adc at 3:20 with 70% hp. Just think of her
        like female Graves support jungler. It is something you have to
        experience and try. Also If I make it to the Exodia build you guys get a
        free win (unless they have mountain soul)! Please do not be that guy
        that complains from the time someone locks it in till the end of the
        game, just focus and try your best!

          Here are the builds and runes if you want to play Caitlyn Jungle for
          youself! You can change up the build however you want, I like to get a
          lot of movespeed. If you win feats make sure you pick up the tier 3
          boots of lucidity as they are really good as the 8% movespeed gain
          when you use an ability might actually be better than swiftness boots.

          RFC gives you extra range if you have trouble hitting the enemy. Force
          of Nature is built when the enemy team is all AP and it gives you 4%
          movespeed, it really is not worth building even if they have 1AD.
          Opportunity is more damage. Dead Man's Plate isn't the best item, its
          not going to save your life, but the extra movespeed and damage is
          nice to have especially if their team has a lot of slows. Maw is
          pretty good if they have someone that is AP going to one shot you like
          a Leblanc and you need it to survive. Serpants fang is good if the
          enemy has a lot of shields like Shieldbow, Lulu shield, mountain soul,
          Sett, barrier etc. Blood thirster is good if the enemy team doesn't
          have too much burst and you can leech off their tanks to heal up.
          Deaths Dance, just buy bloodthirster instead since this item is not
          good on ranged champs. As for GA I feel like it is a trash item.

          I love Kayn so much. I just can't describe it! He's the person of my
          dreams. I feel more for Kayn than I do for any actual person. Every
          night I lie awake in agony thinking about what it would be like to
          hold his hand. Every morning I wake up in tears knowing I will never
          wake up next to him I'll never be able to travel the world with him,
          live my life with him, share all of our experiences together. I'll
          never get to hear his alluring voice whisper things to me that make my
          cheeks flush bright red and cause a warm...

          I've been a Diana Main for a long time, I've seen pretty much all of
          her highs and lows, but I'm pretty sure most people would agree that
          Diana mid is not OP whatsoever atm. Like dont get me wrong, as of
          right now I think shes in a good spot it's just annoying, that I have

          After playing two thousand games of Rengar, I hit the maximum point
          that I can play Rengar the most effectively with my limited mental
          power (thinking skills, cognition) and physical power (dynamic visual
          activity, finger speed, combo generation). I could not learn or
          improve my skills of league of legends and RENGAR by playing some more
          games. I stopped played Rengar and League of Legneds for a few months.
          I tried to find some solutions to improve my game skills.
